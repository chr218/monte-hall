The Monte-Hall Problem.

There are three concealed baskets, one with a gold bullion and the rest with snakes. 

In your mind you pick a basket. But as you reach to uncover it, a snake pops out of an adjacent basket and you hesitate on your original decision.

There remain two baskets. Will you be better off changing your original guess? Does it make a difference?

This code will tell you!
